                 representation-transparent approach to visualization for the
                 web. Rather than hide the underlying scenegraph within a
                 toolkit-specific abstraction, D3 enables direct inspection and
                 manipulation of a native representation: the standard document
                 object model (DOM). With D3, designers selectively bind input
                 data to arbitrary document elements, applying dynamic
                 transforms to both generate and modify content. We show how
                 representational transparency improves expressiveness and
                 better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches,
                 while offering comparable notational efficiency and retaining
                 powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of
                 operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative
                 development. Additionally, we demonstrate how D3 transforms
                 naturally enable animation and interaction with dramatic
                 performance improvements over intermediate representations.",
