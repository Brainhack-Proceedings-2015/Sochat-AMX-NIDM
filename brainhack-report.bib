                 representation-transparent approach to visualization for the
                 web. Rather than hide the underlying scenegraph within a
                 toolkit-specific abstraction, D3 enables direct inspection and
                 manipulation of a native representation: the standard document
                 object model (DOM). With D3, designers selectively bind input
                 data to arbitrary document elements, applying dynamic
                 transforms to both generate and modify content. We show how
                 representational transparency improves expressiveness and
                 better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches,
                 while offering comparable notational efficiency and retaining
                 powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of
                 operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative
                 development. Additionally, we demonstrate how D3 transforms

                 acceleration of scientific discovery. Neuroimaging data is
                 accumulating in distributed domain-specific databases and
                 there is currently no integrated access mechanism nor an
                 accepted format for the critically important meta-data that is
                 necessary for making use of the combined, available
                 neuroimaging data. In this manuscript, we present work from
                 the Derived Data Working Group, an open-access group sponsored
                 by the Biomedical Informatics Research Network (BIRN) and the
                 International Neuroimaging Coordinating Facility (INCF)
                 focused on practical tools for distributed access to
                 neuroimaging data. The working group develops models and tools
                 facilitating the structured interchange of neuroimaging
                 meta-data and is making progress towards a unified set of
                 tools for such data and meta-data exchange. We report on the
                 key components required for integrated access to raw and
                 derived neuroimaging data as well as associated meta-data and
                 provenance across neuroimaging resources. The components
                 include (1) a structured terminology that provides semantic
                 context to data, (2) a formal data model for neuroimaging with
                 robust tracking of data provenance, (3) a web service-based
                 application programming interface (API) that provides a
                 consistent mechanism to access and query the data model, and
                 (4) a provenance library that can be used for the extraction
                 of provenance data by image analysts and imaging software
                 developers. We believe that the framework and set of tools
                 outlined in this manuscript have great potential for solving
                 many of the issues the neuroimaging community faces when
                 sharing raw and derived neuroimaging data across the various

                 electrophysiology data with imaging in patients with
                 refractory epilepsy over recent years. IEEG.org provides a
                 free-access, rapidly growing archive of imaging data combined
                 with electrophysiology data and patient metadata. It currently
                 contains over 1200 human and animal datasets, with multiple
                 data modalities associated with each dataset (neuroimaging,
                 EEG, EKG, de-identified clinical and experimental data, etc.).
                 The platform is developed around the concept that scientific
                 data sharing requires a flexible platform that allows sharing
                 of data from multiple file formats. IEEG.org provides high-
                 and low-level access to the data in addition to providing an
                 environment in which domain experts can find, visualize, and
                 analyze data in an intuitive manner. Here, we present a

                 requires that neuroimaging data be re-used whenever possible.
                 In an effort to further scientific knowledge, the COINS Data
                 Exchange (DX) (http://coins.mrn.org/dx) aims to make data
                 sharing seamless and commonplace. DX takes a three-pronged
                 approach towards improving the overall state of data sharing
                 within the neuroscience community. The first prong is
                 compiling data into one location that has been collected from
                 all over the world in many different formats. The second prong
                 is curating the data so that it can be stored in one
                 consistent format and so that data QA/QC measures can be
                 assured. The third prong is disseminating the data so that it
                 is easy to consume and straightforward to interpret. This
                 paper explains the concepts behind each prong and describes
                 some challenges and successes that the Data Exchange has
                 experienced.",

  abstract    = "Meta-analytic techniques allow cognitive neuroscientists to
                 pool large amounts of data across many individual task-based
                 functional neuroimaging experiments. These methods have been
                 aided by the introduction of online databases such as
                 Brainmap.org or Neurosynth.org, which collate peak activation
                 coordinates obtained from thousands of published studies.
                 Findings from meta-analytic studies typically include brain
                 regions which are consistently activated across studies for
                 specific contrasts, investigating cognitive or clinical
                 hypotheses. These regions can be subsequently used as the
                 basis for seed-based connectivity analysis, or formally
                 compared to neuroimaging data in order to help interpret new
                 findings. To facilitate such approaches, we have developed a
                 new online repository of meta-analytic neuroimaging results,
                 named the Archive of Neuroimaging Meta-analyses (ANIMA). The
                 ANIMA platform consists of an intuitive online interface for
                 querying, downloading, and contributing data from published
                 meta-analytic studies. Additionally, to aid the process of
                 organizing, visualizing, and working with these data, we
                 present an open-source desktop application called Volume
                 Viewer. Volume Viewer allows users to easily arrange imaging
                 data into composite stacks, and save these sessions as
                 individual files, which can also be uploaded to the ANIMA
                 database. The application also allows users to perform basic
                 functions, such as computing conjunctions between images, or
                 extracting regions-of-interest or peak coordinates for further
                 analysis. The introduction of this new resource will enhance
                 the ability of researchers to both share their findings and
                 incorporate existing meta-analytic results into their own
                 research.",

  abstract  = "Surface visualizations of fMRI provide a comprehensive view of
               cortical activity. However, surface visualizations are difficult
               to generate and most common visualization techniques rely on
               unnecessary interpolation which limits the fidelity of the
               resulting maps. Furthermore, it is difficult to understand the
               relationship between flattened cortical surfaces and the
               underlying 3D anatomy using tools available currently. To
               address these problems we have developed pycortex, a Python
               toolbox for interactive surface mapping and visualization.
               Pycortex exploits the power of modern graphics cards to sample
               volumetric data on a per-pixel basis, allowing dense and
               accurate mapping of the voxel grid across the surface.
               Anatomical, functional and fiduciary information can be
               projected onto the cortical surface. The surface can be inflated
               and flattened interactively, aiding interpretation of the
               correspondence between the anatomical surface and the flattened
               cortical sheet. The output of pycortex can be viewed using
               WebGL, a technology compatible with modern web browsers. This
               allows complex fMRI surface maps to be distributed broadly
               online without requiring installation of complex software.",
